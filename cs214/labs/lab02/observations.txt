Flex Example 1:
Flex has taken the code we wrote and has broken it apart into cases, 1 each for "start","stop", and everything else except EOF and EOF.

Flex Example 2:
cab35@englebart:~/Documents/cs214/labs/lab02$ ./example2
1
NUMBER

4
NUMBER

9f
NUMBER
WORD

a
WORD

r2d2
WORD

_a
_WORD

!a
!WORD

9_we
NUBMER
_WORD

When an underscore (or any other character that is not recognized) it parses up to that point, echos the unknown and then continues parsing.  if input started with a number followed by a valid word, the output was "NUMBER" followed by "WORD".

Example 4:
Terminals use the returned values from flex and then output a string to the user.  non-terminals are lowercase and are subseqently defind in the example4.tab.h file.
